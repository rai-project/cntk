description: >
  two stream, 16 pixel prediction stride net, scoring 65.0 mIU on seg11valid
  trained online with high momentum for a ~5 point boost in mean intersection-over-union over the original models.
  These models are trained using extra data from Hariharan et al., but excluding SBD val. FCN-31s is fine-tuned from the ILSVRC-trained VGG-16 model,
  and the finer strides are then fine-tuned in turn. The "at-once" FCN-8s is fine-tuned from VGG-16 all-at-once by scaling the skip connections to better condition optimization.
